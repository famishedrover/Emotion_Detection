 1. At each time point in a video, we pass the corresponding video 
 	frame through a CNN.
 2. The CNN has 3 convolutional layers consisting of 64, 128, and 256 	
 	filters re- spectively, each of size 5x5.
 3. The first two convolutional layers are followed by 2x2 max pooling while the third 
 	layer is fol- lowed by quadrant pooling.
 4. a fully-connected layer with 300 hidden units.
 5. a linear re- gression layer to estimate the valence label


 Cost function : mean squared error (MSE) 

 SGD : batch 128 , 
 momentum : 0.9 
 weight decay of 1e-5. We used a constant learning of 0.01 and 
 did not use any form of annealing.


 training using :  anna software library
